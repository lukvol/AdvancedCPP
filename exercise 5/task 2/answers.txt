Difference between swap and c_swap at compiler level
----------------------------------------------------
There is no difference between the assembly codes generated 
from a function using cswap and a function using swap. 
It appears that the compiler passes references (here int a and int b) 
as pointers. 
However, this does not seem something specified in the C++ specification
but just something a lot of common compilers are doing.

Difference between inline and normal
------------------------------------
There appears to be no difference between the functions having an inline 
keyword and the ones who don't. This is due to the inline keyword only being
a recommendation. The compiler is usually smart enough to decide on its own which
functions to inline and which not to.
